# Firefly

## NOTE: this project is in maintenance-only mode

So no new features will be added (except if someone PRs them - even then you should honestly consider contributing to [Velocity](https://github.com/VelocityPowered/Velocity)). At most I will fix critical issues, or upstream changes
what automatic merge script is unable to handle.

This project will be archived on **1st January 2021**. Feel free to fork off.

## License

All the patches are MIT, except those which have authors / source / original commit linked. If you have issues with 3rd
party code licensing (accidentally forgotten attribution etc.) then let me know.
